# Zerone 

I wrote this tiny framework to run my code automatically whenever I save it. 
Especially, it's useful when I solve puzzles(e.g., HackerRank) which involves more debug time. 


## How to use it

It's super easy - only one step.

`bundle exec guard`

Languages support:
- Ruby
- Rust

## How to install

You need Ruby(see .ruby-verison) and Rustc(When build *.rs)

- Clone the source files
- Install Ruby and bundler gem
- Go to root folder and `bundle install`
